- Remember the bare minimum code that index.android.js file must have
  - { AppRegistry } from 'react-native'
  - AppRegistry.registerComponent('project-name', () => App), where App is the outer most component

- Always have an outer most parent component and then have both index.android and index.ios
  point to it.

- Always write reusable component code
  - These reusable files can be put into one folder and exported through a single index file
    - export * from './component-name'

- 'flex' property of flexbox
  - its kinda like the grid system in Bootstrap: sections divided among subcomponents; adding to 12
  - example (with flexDirection: 'column'):

        ___         ___
        |           |        
        |          A flex: 3
        |           |___
      parent flex   |
        must be     |
        flex: 1     | 
        |          B flex: 5
        |           |
        |__         |___

        - In this example, A will take 3/8 of the parent, B takes 5/8
        - 1 is the maximum allowable size!
